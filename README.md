# Football-match-prediction

Application for predicting the result of a football match.
Random Forest, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) were used.
The following accuracies were obtained:

|              | Training data  | Validation data |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---:   |
|              | accuracy	loss  | accuracy	loss  |
| Random Forest| 0.6123    -    | 0.6123    	-   |
|CNN           | 0.5286 	0.9756|	0.5038	  1.0026|
|LSTM          | 0.7439	  0.7856|	0.7258	  0.8312|
